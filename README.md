# A Not-Too-Short Summary of Algorithms

This repository is an attempt of sharing solutions, animations and theory towards the study of algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction

This repository compiles insights gathered from various online sources. It explores diverse topics such as binary trees, dynamic programming, graphs... and presents exercises solutions from different sources and platforms like LeetCode.

## Contents
- **Summary**: [Summary Link](https://algo.n2sqseries.com/), you'll find a detailed summary titled "A Not-Too-Short Summary of *Algorithms*".

- **Animations**: Explore visual aids that I've created to enhance understanding of algorithms.

- **Problems**: Dive into a collection of problems sourced from online platforms (ex: LeetCode) for practice.

- **Theory**: Discover foundational code examples that illustrate the practical creation of data structures and algorithms using Python.

## Purpose

This repository is all about collecting code examples, explanations, and problem solutions, with the goal of helping others :)

## Conclusion

Happy coding!
