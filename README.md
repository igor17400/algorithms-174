# algorithms-174 - My Study Repository for Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to my personal repository dedicated to the exploration and study of algorithms and data structures.

## Introduction

This repository serves as my personal playground for improving my skills in algorithms and data structures. Here, I delve into various topics including binary trees, dynamic programming, graphs, and tackle exercises from platforms like LeetCode. 

## Disclaimer 

A lot of codes are inspired from tutorials such as (https://neetcode.io/), videos and even from the famous CLRS book.

## Example of Contents

- **Binary Trees**: Explore implementations and algorithms related to binary trees.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Dive into dynamic programming techniques for solving optimization problems.
- **Graphs**: Study graph data structures and algorithms for graph traversal and manipulation.
- **LeetCode Exercises**: Solve a variety of problems from LeetCode

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is that maintaining a collection of code implementations, explanations, and problem solutions, I seek to track my progress and reinforce key concepts over time. And maybe help someone else too :)

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning space, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback from fellow learners in the field of computer science. If you find errors, optimizations, or interesting insights, feel free to open issues or pull requests. Let's learn and grow together!
