    "**Example:** Imagine we are going to the supermarket, and we want to buy a selection of products to take with us to the park. We have only one backpack with a certain capacity, and we want to maximize the total value of the products we can fit into our backpack. The condition here is that we can only choose one product of each type.\n",

    "- Product 2: cost $ c_2 = 100 $, weight $ w_2 = 20 $\n",
    "- Product 3: cost $ c_3 = 120 $, weight $ w_3 = 30 $\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine the maximum value of the backpack when products are not allowed to be fractioned. In this example, we should take Product 2 and Product 3 to maximize the total value. Thus, the total value would be 220.\n",

    "### Memoization Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. This avoids the need to recompute results for the same inputs, significantly improving the time complexity in many cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts of Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cache Storage:**\n",
    "   Memoization involves creating a cache (typically a dictionary or array) where the results of function calls are stored. The cache keys are the function arguments, and the cache values are the computed results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Function Modification:**\n",
    "   The original function is modified to first check if the result for a given input is already in the cache. If it is, the cached result is returned immediately, bypassing the computation. If not, the function computes the result, stores it in the cache, and then returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time Complexity Improvement:**\n",
    "   By avoiding redundant calculations, memoization can transform algorithms with exponential time complexity into those with polynomial time complexity. This is particularly effective in dynamic programming, where overlapping subproblems are common.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Implement Memoization\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify the Overlapping Subproblems:**\n",
    "   Determine the parts of the algorithm where the same calculations are repeated multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Cache:**\n",
    "   Initialize a data structure to store the results of these subproblems. A dictionary is commonly used for its efficient look-up time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Modify the Function:**\n",
    "   Before performing any calculation, the function should check if the result is already in the cache. If it is, return the cached result. If not, compute the result, store it in the cache, and then return it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This optimizes the naive approach using a <span style=\"background-color: #F9F9E0;\">memoization technique</span>, significantly improving the time complexity to $O(n \\cdot m)$.\n"
