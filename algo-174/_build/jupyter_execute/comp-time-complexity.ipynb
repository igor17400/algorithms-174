Each subproblem is solved on a subarray of $n/2$ elements (our assumption that the original problem size is a power of 2 ensures that $n/2$ is an integer), so we spend $T(n/2)$ time solving each subproblem. Since we solve two subproblems, for the *left* and *right* subarrays, the time spent will be $2T(n/2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to analyze the time for the `find_maximum_crossing_subarray` function. If the subarray $A[\\text{low} \\cdots \\text{high}]$ contains $n$ entries (so that $n = \\text{high} - \\text{low} + 1$), we claim that `find_maximum_crossing_subarray(A, low, mid, high)` takes $\\Theta(n)$ time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since each iteration of the two for loops takes $\\Theta(1)$ time, we just need to count how many iterations there are altogether. The first for loop makes $\\text{mid} - \\text{low} + 1$ iterations, and the second makes $\\text{high} - \\text{mid}$ iterations. Thus, the total number of iterations is:\n",
