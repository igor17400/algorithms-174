**WHAT TO EXPECT:**

This work aims to deliver, as the title suggests, a summary of algorithms that strikes a balance—not too short, yet not overly detailed like a comprehensive textbook. My intention was to explore essential algorithms in computer science with more depth than a typical summary offers, yet not as extensively as a canonical textbook. While this isn’t just a collection of info-graphics or codes, it also isn’t a divine manuscript descended from the heavens (CLRS book - “Introduction to Algorithms”). Ultimately, I hope this proves useful to someone beyond myself. If you’ve read this far, thank you, and stay safe!
